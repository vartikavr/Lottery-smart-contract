# Lottery-smart-contract
A basic lottery game smart contract. <br/>
## Basic functioning
- Any user on the Ethereum network can enter the lottery (as a player). 
- The player would have to fulfill the minimum requirement of sending more than 0.01 ether to the               lottery pool, in order to enter the lottery.
- The winner of the lottery would be generated randomly. Only the Manager ie. the person who deploys the contract can pick up the winner.
- The lottery gets reset after a winner is picked.
