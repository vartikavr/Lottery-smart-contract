# Lottery-smart-contract
A basic lottery game smart contract. <br/>
<h2>Basic functioning</h2>
Any user on the Ethereum network can enter the lottery (as a player). The player would have to fulfill the minimum requirement of sending more than 0.01 ether to the lottery pool, in order to enter the lottery. <br/>
The winner of the lottery would be generated randomly. Only the Manager ie. the person who deploys the contract can pick up the winner. <br/>
The lottery gets reset after a winner is picked. <br/>
